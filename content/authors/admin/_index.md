Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano, advised by Marcello Restelli. In 2017, I obtained a Master of Science in Computer Science with the Honours Programme (110/110 cum laude) from la Sapienza advised by Flavio Chierichetti. My research interests lie in machine learning and mathematical modelling, with a focus on reinforcement learning and multiagent learning.

In my previous life I worked on Social Network Analysis with Marco Brambilla and Stefano Ceri, and on Networking with Gaia Maselli.
